## All hail the mighty `<a>` element

- The anchor tag is the tag used to link from the document a user is on to another document elsewhere on the internet, or another point in the same document.
- A welcome benefit of HTML5 is that we can wrap multiple elements in an a tag.

```
<a href="index.html">  
   <h2>The home page</h2>  
   <p>This paragraph also links to the home page</p>  
   <img src="home-image.png" alt="A rendering of the home page" />
</a> 
   ```
- The only limitations to keep in mind with a tags are that, understandably, you can’t wrap one `<a>` tag within another `<a>` tag or other interactive element (such as a button) and you can’t wrap a form in an a tag either.

## New semantic elements in HTML5
- Semantics is the process of giving our markup meaning.
- Most websites follow fairly standard structural conventions; typical areas include a header, a footer, a sidebar, a navigation bar, and so on. As web authors, we will often name the divs we use to more clearly designate these areas (for example, ```<div class="Header">```).
-  However, as far as the code itself goes, any user agent parsing that content – and that includes a web browser, screen reader, search engine crawler, and so on – couldn’t say for sure what the purpose of each of these div elements is. HTML5 solves that problem with new semantic elements.

- Knowing that elements exist to convey certain meaning is a huge part of making accessible websites and applications.

In terms of the HTML specification, the elements we will be looking at fall into one of three groups:

-   Sectioning elements, for the broadest strokes in an HTML page. These are the kind of elements to use for header, footer, and sidebar areas.
    
-   Grouping elements, which are used to wrap associated elements. Think of paragraphs, blockquotes, and content of that nature.
    
-   Text-level semantics, which are the elements we use to designate particulars, like a sec- tion of bold or italic text or code.
