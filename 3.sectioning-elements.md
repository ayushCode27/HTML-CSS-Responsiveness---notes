## The ```<main>``` element
 - Whether you’re wrapping the main content of a page or the main section of a web-based application, the main element is what you should be grouping it all with. Here’s a particularly useful line from the specification:

	 - *The main content area of a document includes content that is unique to that document and excludes content that is repeated across a set of documents such as site navigation links, copyright information, site logos and banners, and search forms (unless the document or application’s main function is that of a search form).*
 

- It’s also worth noting that there shouldn’t be more than one main on each page (after all, you can’t have two main pieces of content) and it shouldn’t be used as a descendent child element of some of the other semantic HTML5 elements, such as article, aside, header, footer, or nav. 

## The ```<section>``` element
- The section element is used to define a generic section of a document or application. For exam- ple, you may choose to create sections around your content; one section for contact information, another section for news feeds, and so on. It’s important to understand that this element isn’t intended for styling purposes; if you need to wrap an element merely to style it, you should con- tinue to use a div as you would have before.

- You can also qualify for yourself whether you should be using a section element based on whether the content you are sectioning has a natural heading within it (for example, an h1-h6). If it doesn’t, it’s likely you’d be better off opting for a div.

## The ```<nav>``` element

- The nav element is used to wrap major navigational links to other pages or parts within the same page. As it is for use in major navigational blocks, it isn’t strictly intended for use in footers (al- though it can be) and the like, where groups of links to other pages are common.

-  If you usually mark up your navigational elements with an unordered list (ul) and a bunch of list tags (li), you may be better served with a nav and a number of nested a tags instead.

## The ```<article>``` element

 - The article element is used to wrap a self-contained piece of content. When structuring a page, ask whether the content you’re intending to use within an article tag could be taken as a whole lump and pasted onto a different site and still make complete sense. 

 - Another way to think about it is, would the content that you are considering wrapping in an article actually constitute a separate article in an RSS feed? Obvious examples of content that should be wrapped with an article element would be blog posts or news stories. Be aware that if nesting article elements, it is presumed that the nested article elements are principally related to the outer article.

## The ```<aside>``` element

- The aside element is used for content that is tangentially related to the content around it. In practical terms, I often use it for sidebars, or content in a little tip about a related subject in a blog post.

- It’s also considered suitable for pull quotes, advertising, and groups of navigation el- ements. Basically, anything not directly related to the main content would work well in an aside. If it was an e-commerce site, I’d consider areas like Customers who bought this also bought as prime candidates for an aside.

## The ```<header>``` element

- Practically, the header can be used for the “masthead” area of a site’s header but also as an in- troduction to other content, such as an introduction section within an article element. You can use it as many times on the same page as needed. You could have a header inside every section on your page, for example.

## The ```<footer>``` element

- It should be used to contain information about the section it sits within. It might contain links to other documents or copyright information, for example. Like the header, it can be used multiple times within a page if needed. 

- For example, it could be used for the footer of a blog but also a footer within a blog post article on that same blog. However, the specification notes that contact information for the author of a blog post should instead be wrapped by an address element.
