## Responsive web design in a nutshell

- it’s the presentation of web content in the most relevant format for the viewport and device accessing it.
- By default, web pages are inherently flexible. If I open the html page with no special work done to make it responsive, and resize the browser window, the text re-flows as needed.
- The area of a browser window that a web page is allowed to be viewed in is known technically as the **viewport**. To be clear, the viewport area excludes the browser toolbars and URL bar etc.
- We can make the page more mobile friendly by adding this snippet in the <head>: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0" />`
	- This viewport meta tag is the non-standard but de facto way of telling the browser how to render the page.
	- our **viewport meta tag** is effectively saying “make the content render at the width of the device.”
- We want a responsive design – something that is agnostic of the screen size viewing it, responding to any size viewport it finds itself in, not something that only looks its best at specific sizes.
-  A **breakpoint** is just a point, typically a screen width, at which we use a media query to alter the design
- Use a breakpoint if your design, visually, needs to change at a certain point, but not to cater to a specific device!
- The first rules we write, outside of a media query, should be our starter, or “base,” rules for the most basic devices, which we then enhance for more capable devices and larger screens.
- When you write CSS for responsive design, start with base styles that can work on any device, typically the smallest screen, and then use media queries to adapt for larger screens
- This approach also facilitates a “smallest screen first” mentality and allows us to progressively layer on detail as and when the design needs to change for bigger screens.
- **Vendor prefixes** have been employed historically to prefix experimental CSS properties in different browsers. For example: -webkit-backface-visibility. Including vendor prefixes in CSS is often essential to achieve support for certain properties in older browsers. There are now tools to automate this prefixing and, as you might imagine, the tools perform the task faster and more accurately than we can.

## Tools

- CSS post-processors such as PostCSS can automate horrible and thankless jobs like CSS vendor prefixing, an old requirement that necessitated writing multiple versions of a property for each browser engine, and poly-filling new CSS features, where newer syntaxes can be made to work on older browsers. 
- Linting and validation tools can check your HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code as you work, eliminating many time-wasting typos or syntax-induced errors. 
- More recently, code formatters have become popular. Tools like Prettier, for example, automatically format your code with indentation and spacing when you save.
