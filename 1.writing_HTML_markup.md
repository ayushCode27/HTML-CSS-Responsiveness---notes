# Writing HTML Markup

- HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is a language that allows content to be marked up in a manner that makes it more understandable to technology, and then, in turn, humans. You can have content on the web without CSS or without JavaScript. But you can’t have human-friendly content without HTML.
- Writing good quality HTML is a prerequisite of anything that you want to be accessible to all users of the web.
- A few elements, like the meta tag in the example above, are known as **void elements**, these don’t wrap around anything, and hence are **self-closing** – notice the closing forward slash at the end with no element name.
- HTML has forgiving nature, it will still work even if there No end tag/slash, no quotes, wrong capitalization on atrributes.
-  Consider the HTML5 Boilerplate https://html5boilerplate.com. It’s a pre-made “best practice” HTML5 file. You can also custom-build the template to match your specific needs.
- Checking that markup validates catches basic human errors like missing or mismatched tags, missing alt attributes on images, incorrectly nested elements, and so on. The W3C validator was created for just this reason: https://validator.w3.org/.
